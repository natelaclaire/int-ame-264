# Assessments

There are many different ways that we learn, as explored by [Howard Gardner’s *Multiple Intelligences*](https://www.tecweb.org/styles/gardner.html). The assessments in this course each invite the student to use the format(s) that they find most useful for learning.

## Video Game Giants

Each student will select a prominent figure from the video game industry—such as a designer, artist, writer, programmer, composer, hardware developer, or another key contributor—and create an informative profile of that individual. The profile should explore the individual’s impact on the industry and provide personal insights into why you chose them. This assignment is self-paced \- it can be completed at any time throughout the course.

### **The Profile Should Include:**

* A brief introduction to the individual and their background.  
* Key contributions to the video game industry (major works, innovations, or influence).  
* Personal insights explaining why you selected this figure.  
* Any additional interesting facts or stories about their career or legacy.

**Format and Submission:**

* **Length**: Written profiles should be 500-750 words. Alternatively, you can create a **multimedia presentation** (video, PowerPoint, etc.) that lasts 5-7.5 minutes.  
* **Citations:** Any sources used should be cited in some format (especially for quotes or lesser-known facts).  
* **Submission**: Each student needs to submit one profile during the course at the time of the student’s choice. Profiles will be posted to a discussion forum when ready.  
* **Engagement**: Students are expected to actively engage by reading and responding to profiles. Share your thoughts and ask questions. Thoughtful engagement will contribute to your participation grade.

The goal is to foster an ongoing conversation about the key players who have shaped the gaming world while allowing you to explore individuals whose work inspires or interests you.

[Discussion Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3WEXY2kG7tArZykGCnNJj7r8zR-QKeI65zgSfeztp4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Video Game Analysis

Each week, a selection of students will be assigned to analyze a game of their choice. Each student will be selected 2-3 times throughout the course to present their analysis.

**Your task:** Choose a video game and provide a detailed analysis that evaluates its suitability for different age groups and explores how it aligns with developmental, educational, or social needs.

**The Analysis Should Include:**

1. **Age Appropriateness vs. Age Popularity**  
   * Identify the age group(s) the game is *recommended* for by the developer or other authoritative sources (e.g., [ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/), [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)).  
   * Investigate the actual age group(s) for which the game is *popular*. These two groups may not always align, so explain any discrepancies.  
2. **Strengths and Weaknesses for Each Age Group**  
   * Analyze the game's strengths and weaknesses concerning different age groups. Consider educational value, cognitive development, social interaction, or potential harm.  
   * Use evidence from research and expert opinions to support your evaluation. For example, are there concerns about violence, in-game purchases, or inappropriate content for certain ages?  
3. **Social and Cultural Analysis**  
   * Does the game offer diverse representation in characters, themes, or storylines? Are there any stereotypes or problematic portrayals?  
   * How does the game reflect, challenge, or reinforce cultural norms and values? Consider aspects like gender roles, moral choices, nationalism, or historical narratives.  
   * What kind of social environment does the game foster? Does it encourage cooperation, competition, toxicity, or inclusivity? Look at the player community, in-game interactions, or online discourse surrounding the game.  
4. **Best Practices and Recommendations**  
   * Provide best practices for using the game with different age groups. Include suggestions for parents, educators, or players on how to maximize the game’s benefits or mitigate any negative aspects.  
   * Offer recommendations for follow-up activities, conversations, or alternative games if the one you reviewed has significant drawbacks.  
5. **Personal Experience (if applicable)**  
   * If you have personal experience with the game, reflect on how your findings align or differ from your own interactions with it. Did the game meet your expectations for the targeted age group?

**Format and Submission:**

* **Length**: Written analyses should be 500-750 words. Alternatively, you can create a **multimedia presentation** (video, PowerPoint, etc.) that lasts 5-7.5 minutes.  
* **Citations:** Any sources used should be cited in some format (especially for quotes or lesser-known facts).  
* **Submission**: Post your analysis in the class discussion forum by the assigned date.  
* **Engagement**: Students who are not assigned to submit a review for the week are expected to actively engage by reading and responding to at least two peer reviews. Share your thoughts, ask questions, or discuss the game’s relevance in different contexts. Thoughtful engagement will contribute to your participation grade.

**Examples for Guidance:**

* You might find that a game like *Minecraft* is popular with younger children (ages 7-12) but is actually recommended for older ages due to online interactions or complex gameplay elements. Research how experts suggest parents monitor these interactions or encourage creative building strategies.  
* Another example could be *Fortnite*, which may have wide appeal with kids aged 10-15, yet parents and experts express concerns about in-game purchases and exposure to violence.

By the end of the course, you’ll have an opportunity to explore a wide range of games from various genres and perspectives, gaining a better understanding of their cultural, educational, and developmental impact.

## Video Game Journal

Throughout the course, students will submit reflective journals, which may be in the format of written text (300-500 words), video, audio, or other multimedia format (3-5 minutes). This journal will serve as a space to connect personally with the course content and explore your thoughts on video games, both from your own experience and from external influences.

### **Your Journal Should Include:**

1. **Response to Prompts**: Address any specific prompts provided in the class content. These may ask for your reflections, opinions, or analyses of key concepts, discussions, or themes.  
2. **Personal Reflections**: Share your thoughts, questions, or ideas related to the week’s material. This is an opportunity to express your perspective, challenges, or connections you’ve made between class content and your own experiences.  
3. **Video Game Engagement**:  
   * **Games You Played**: If applicable, review any video games you played during the week. Discuss aspects such as gameplay, design, narrative, or anything that stood out to you from a player or academic perspective.  
   * **Games You’ve Heard About or Look Forward To**: Reflect on any games you’ve heard about through news, conversations, or online communities. You may also include any thoughts on games you’re excited to play in the future, explaining why they intrigue you.  
4. **Social & Cultural Analysis:** Regarding the video games with which you engaged and, optionally, any video games discussed in the course since the last journal, examine how the games reflect, challenge, or reinforce cultural values, identities, or societal issues. Some questions to consider:  
   * How does the game represent gender, race, class, or other social identities?  
   * What messages (explicit or implicit) does the game communicate about society, history, or politics?  
   * How do real-world events, cultural movements, or historical moments influence the game’s content, development, or reception?  
   * How does the gaming community engage with this game (e.g., controversies, fan culture, critical discussions)?

**Format and Submission:**

* **Length**: Written submissions should be 300-500 words. Alternatively, you can create a **multimedia presentation** (video, PowerPoint, etc.) that lasts 3-5 minutes.  
* **Citations:** While this is primarily focused on personal reflection, any sources used should be cited in some format (especially for quotes or lesser-known facts).  
* **Submission**: These journals will be submitted directly to the instructor and will not be shared with the class. However, content from journals may be used anonymously in class discussions or materials to enrich learning.

This journal is a space for you to engage critically and personally with the course material, while also linking your real-world experiences with video games. It’s designed to encourage reflection, creativity, and deeper understanding of both academic and personal gaming experiences.

## Final Project: Analyzing the Historical and Cultural Context of a Video Game

Each student will select a video game and conduct a comprehensive analysis that incorporates many, if not all, of the following key areas. This analysis will be delivered as a paper of **at least 1,500 words** and/or another format such as video, audio, a PowerPoint presentation, or another creative medium. A combination of a written paper along with multimedia elements such as images, gameplay clips, and/or diagrams is ideal and the length of the paper may be adjusted to account for any such non-written components. Proper citations must be included.

### **Key Areas of Analysis:**

#### **1\. Historical Context and Influences**

* **Historical Events/Periods:** Examine which real-world historical events, periods, or figures influenced the game's setting, plot, or characters. For example, how *Assassin's Creed* draws from specific historical periods.  
* **Accuracy of Depiction:** Discuss the accuracy of these depictions. What does the game get right about the period, and where does it deviate from historical reality? Why might the developers have chosen to alter history, and what effect does this have on player perception?  
* **Cultural Representation:** How are different cultures represented within the game? Are these representations respectful, stereotypical, or otherwise notable?

#### **2\. Impact on the Video Game Industry**

* **Genre Evolution:** How did the game influence or advance its specific genre? For instance, how *The Legend of Zelda* series pushed the boundaries of open-world exploration or how *Doom* established first-person shooters.  
* **Technological Innovations:** What innovations in technology, graphics, or gameplay mechanics did this game introduce? How did these shape future games?  
* **Monetary and Critical Success:** Analyze the game's commercial success, critical reception, and any awards won. How did this success influence the development or marketing of future titles within or outside the same franchise?

#### **3\. Societal and Cultural Impact**

* **Audience Reception and Social Discourse:** Investigate how the game was received by its audience upon release. Did it spark any notable discussions or controversies related to themes like violence, gender, race, or other social issues? What long-term effects, if any, did it have on public discourse around gaming or social norms?  
* **Ethical Considerations:** Were there any ethical dilemmas tied to the game's content? Think of games like *Grand Theft Auto* and its controversies surrounding violence and crime, or *Call of Duty* for its portrayal of modern warfare. How does the game handle moral ambiguity, player choices, or consequences?  
* **Cultural Longevity:** How has the game or its themes remained culturally relevant since its release? Are there communities, modders, or fans who continue to engage with the game in ways that keep it alive long after its original release?

#### **4\. Influence of New Technologies and Game Design Concepts**

* **Game Engines and Development Tools:** How did new game engines or development tools enable the creation of this game? For instance, how *Unreal Engine* has shaped many modern games. What breakthroughs in AI, physics engines, or user interface design were critical for the game's development?  
* **Player Interaction and Engagement:** Examine any new design concepts the game introduced in terms of player interaction, narrative structure, or world-building. Did it use new ways of engaging players, such as branching narratives, sandbox design, or multiplayer elements that were innovative for its time?

#### **5\. Comparison with Similar Titles (Before and After)**

* **Historical Evolution:** Compare the chosen game to similar titles released before and after. How did earlier games influence its design? In what ways did this game innovate within its genre, and how did later games draw from it?  
* **Cultural and Industry Shifts:** Reflect on how shifts in gaming culture or industry practices, such as the rise of indie games, microtransactions, or eSports, may have influenced the game or been influenced by it. Compare how these aspects are handled in older vs. newer games in the same genre.

#### **6\. Personal Reflection and Critical Insight**

* **Player Experience:** Reflect on your own experience with the game. How did the game's historical and cultural elements affect your engagement? Did the game succeed in conveying its message or theme to you as a player? Why or why not?  
* **Critique:** Offer a critical analysis of the game's strengths and weaknesses in the areas you’ve discussed. Could the game have approached certain themes differently? How would you improve or change aspects of the game, from a historical or cultural perspective?

**Format and Submission:**

* **Length**: Written submissions should be **at least 1,500 words**. This may be adjusted depending on the complexity/length of any non-written portion of your submission. If you are including a significant non-written component(s), please discuss length requirements with the instructor.  
* **Citations:** Any sources used should be cited in some format (MLA/APA/Chicago/other).  
* **Submission**: This will be submitted directly to the instructor, who will share with the class once all have been submitted.
